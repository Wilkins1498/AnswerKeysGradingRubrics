                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>My name is Anthony Wilkins. I am currently 19 years old when writing this and am attending Parkland College online. I live with my step-mom and with my dad. I also have a sister at home as well as American Eskimo dog named Bear. My father works at <a href="http://www.plastipak.com/">PlastiPak</a> while my mother works at <a href="https://www.idealautosales.com/">Ideal Auto Sales</a> in Matoon as the general manager for that particular building.</p>

                <p>My birth mother is stationed in California, and I say stationed because she is in the Army. She is married to a a good man named Shiloh Holland and have a kid named Aiden Mark Holland, he is only 3 at the moment.  My mom had a child with a late husband named Jovan -insert middle name here- Gasper Crowder. And he is black.  Jovan is an MMA fighter, and is very happy with his choice, so much for being a lawyer.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>In my free time I usually spend it alone, if I can help it. I don't really have that many friends, frankly I am pretty sure that I only have one at the moment. But that friend has introduced me to alot of new things I like to do. There are many animes that she has introduced me to. I haven't liked them all, but I don't want to hurt her feelings. She has shown me new <abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPG</abbr> and several comics. I like to write in my freetime, though only when I can. The only thing I will tell you about my book is that it has <dfn> ninjas</dfn> which by definition  "A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び, "to sneak") was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan." (<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja">wikipedia.com</a></cite>) <del>Which are dumb! Samurai forever!</del></p>

                <p>One thing I have been reading up on is some code books and websites. I have deduced that I literally know nothing about code. I dont know the difference between <code></code></p>

                <p>Now I work at the must alustrious gas station called Casey's. Before I go on, here is one of our many slogans:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <pre>
                        Casey's: A General Store and A Whole Lot More
                        Casey's: Famous For Pizza
                        Casey's: Famous For Fresh
                    </pre>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I do not like these slogans at all. They are dumb and just aggravate me. But at my job I work from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I work in the kitchen making all the pizza and other food for the warmers. I also make the pizza dough, cut veggies, clean whatever thing is dirty, and make cookies or muffins when I need to.</p>

                <p>I also did the truck, but at the moment I am not on the truck...so sad. I would help the girls, ther is only one other guy and he works at night, unload the truck and put away the freezer food that we use in the kitchen. I would also put away the drinks inside the cooler that we get.</p>

                <p>Even when I am not doing the kitchen I am always working. I do not take any breaks at all, even though I am allowed to do so. I take the time to do the drink cooler. I will stock it with the drinks that we already have.</p>
